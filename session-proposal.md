* Session Title: **Let's Build Firefox OS Apps**
* Presenter: Kumar McMillan [@kumar303](https://twitter.com/kumar303)

Mozilla launched a mobile operating system built entirely on web technology called [Firefox OS](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/) (code named Boot To Gecko). If you know how to build a website then you'll know how to build an app for it. Firefox OS harnesses standard HTML5 APIs but Mozilla had to create some missing web APIs for apps to fully interact with mobile devices. As a Firefox OS developer you can use web technology to create rich, immersive mobile experiences that are easily compatible with the desktop web and other web based platforms such as [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/). Firefox OS's new web APIs are on a [standards track](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI) so that other devices can soon support them. This means that you can build an app *once* and run it everywhere: your desktop, your phone, your tablet, and so on. Let's build web apps!

**What will your session allow people to make, learn or do?**

At the end of the session, participants will have built a mobile web app that can run on Firefox OS devices. They will understand how a standard website can be transformed into an open web app using a single manifest file. They will learn about which web APIs to use when trying to hook into specific features such as geolocation, small screen size, local storage, ambient light sensors, proximity sensors, accepting payments, and so on.

**How do you see that working?**

The session will be optimized for small, self-organized work groups. I'll start by doing a *very brief* overview and provide a web page with links to all the tools and documentation needed. As soon as possible, I'll break them into groups to let them begin building apps. While that's happening I'll explain some concepts further for anyone who is feeling lost. This will allow self-learners to dive in and tune me out.

I'll show participants how to use the [Firefox OS Simulator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Firefox_OS_Simulator) to do all development. This is an add-on for Firefox so I'll also bring it on a USB stick so that people can install it quickly. I'll provide at least four demo apps that they can use as starter templates. The templates will be based on [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/) and [brick](https://github.com/mozilla/brick). One app will be a game, one will be a productivity type of app, one will be [an app that accepts payments](https://github.com/jlongster/webfighter), and one will be the [boilerplate app](https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App/) which has an example of all APIs. The Firefox OS Simulator is all they will need to develop apps. The example apps can be used as a starting point -- once you have the source you can run each app on the Simulator, edit the app and watch it change. All you need to run the Simulator is the Firefox web browser.


I'll have as many Firefox OS devices as I can borrow on hand and I'll show people how to use the Simulator to push apps to devices if they want to test on device. This isn't strictly necessary. They'll only need to test on device if they are using APIs like sensors that don't exist in the Simulator.

**How will you deal with 5, 15, 50 participants?**

I'll suggest that people break into teams of 3-5 people but I'll also allow for self-organizing teams. Each team will work collaboratively to build an app. If we have close to 50 people I'll suggest larger groups. I'm also going to try recruiting some local Firefox OS engineers so that I can put one expert per group to help anyone who gets stuck. As soon as I finish some of the introductory info I'll make myself available to help anyone who is stuck.

**How long within your session before someone else can teach this?**

The very first thing I'll do is pass around multiple USB sticks with the Firefox OS Simulator add-on. I'll do a very brief demo of the Simulator but it's pretty self-explanatory. It simulates a Firefox OS device and lets you interact with your app as if it were on a device. For self-learners they will be able to teach this to someone else in about 10 minutes. The Simulator and the example apps are all anyone needs to begin development or teach someone else how to develop apps. 

**What outcomes would you like to see after the session?**

I'd like to see participants walk way with some kind of Firefox OS app that runs in the Simulator. If there's time, I'd like to see people demo their apps at the end of the session. Eventually, I'd like to see all apps submitted to the [Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/) for distribution. I expect that teammates will bond with each other during the process so it's likely that some groups will continue working together beyond the session.

**What organisations or companies might be interested to participate in this session?**

Any organization that wants to reach the millions of people in emerging markets who own or will soon own Firefox OS devices would be interested to learn about building apps. Any organization who has already built a web app will be especially interested in Firefox OS because the porting process is trivial. If an organization already maintains iOS or Android apps they will be interested to learn about creating Firefox OS apps.

**Is this session appropriate and interesting for a younger audience (under 18)?**

Yes.
